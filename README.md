# üöÄ Spaceship-Titanic - Extensive EDA  

This project explores an **Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Spaceship Titanic** dataset. The dataset originates from a fictional **interstellar disaster scenario**, similar to the Titanic tragedy, but set in space. The goal is to analyze and understand patterns in passenger data to derive meaningful insights for predictive modeling.  

### üîç Key Aspects of the Project:  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.  
- **Feature Analysis**: Understanding categorical and numerical variables.  
- **Visualization**: Using Matplotlib & Seaborn for insightful plots.  
- **Statistical Insights**: Correlation analysis and hypothesis testing.  

This EDA lays the foundation for future **machine learning models** by uncovering data trends and relationships.
